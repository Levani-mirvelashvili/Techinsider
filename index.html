    <p>The internet is a global network used by individuals and organizations worldwide. The World Wide Web consists of billions of interconnected computers, including not just home desktops but also various types of devices. Your computer connects to a server via an Internet Service Provider (ISP). Your computer is connected to the Server device through IPS. Internet service provider. (Server computers are different, setup is different. Infrastructure is different. They are constantly working machines to provide services without interruption. They don't use general OS. The server machine needs to run on web server software. Web server is optimized to handle millions of requests effortlessly.)</p>
    <p>End users utilize the internet for communication, entertainment, and information retrieval. Companies leverage the internet to increase brand awareness, generate revenue streams, and communicate with both potential and loyal customers.</p>

    <p>C++ is a widely used computer programming language, known for its efficiency in machine-level communication. It is a high-level programming language that extends the C language by incorporating object-oriented features. C++ supports both static and dynamic type checking.

HTML and CSS are not programming languages; they are markup languages that define elements in documents and do not require compilation.</p>
